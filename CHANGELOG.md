# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v5 (Unrealeased)](https://github.com/jeertmans/languagetool-rust/compare/v4.16.0...HEAD)

Prior to v5, there was no real CHANGELOG other than the GitHub releases,
with most of the content automatically generated by GitHub from merged
pull requests.

In an effort to better document changes, this CHANGELOG document is now created.

### Chore

- Automatically concatenate all animations from a slide into one.
  This is a **breaking change** because the config file format is
  different from the previous one. For migration help, see associated PR.

### Removed

- Removed `--start-at-animation-number` option from `manim-slides present`.
