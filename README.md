# Manim Slides

Tool for live presentations using either [Manim (community edition)](https://www.manim.community/) or [ManimGL](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/). Manim Slides will *automatically* detect the one you are using!

> **_NOTE:_**  This project extends the work of [`manim-presentation`](https://github.com/galatolofederico/manim-presentation), with a lot more features!

## Installation

While installing Manim Slides and its dependencies on your global Python is fine, I recommend using a [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) for a local installation.

### Dependencies

Manim Slides requires either Manim or ManimGL to be installed. Having both packages installed is fine too.

If none of those packages are installed, please refer to their specific installation guidelines:
- [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html)
- [ManimGL](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/getting_started/installation.html)

### Pip Install

The recommended way to install the latest release is to use pip:

```bash
pip install manim-slides
```

### Install From Repository

An alternative way to install Manim Slides is to clone the git repository, and install from there:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeertmans/manim-slides
pip install -e .
```

> *Note:* the `-e` flag allows you to edit the files, and observe the changes directly when using Manim Slides

## Usage

Using Manim Slides is a two-step process:
1. Render animations using `Slide` (resp. `ThreeDSlide`) as a base class instead of `Scene` (resp. `ThreeDScene`), and add calls to `self.pause()` everytime you want to create a new slide.
2. Run `manim-slides` on rendered animations and display them like a *Power Point* presentation.

The command-line documentation is available [online](https://eertmans.be/manim-slides/).

### Basic Example


Wrap a series of animations between `self.start_loop()` and `self.stop_loop()` when you want to loop them (until input to continue):

```python
# example.py

from manim import *
# or: from manimlib import *
from manim_slides import Slide

class Example(Slide):
    def construct(self):
        circle = Circle(radius=3, color=BLUE)
        dot = Dot()

        self.play(GrowFromCenter(circle))
        self.pause()  # Waits user to press continue to go to the next slide

        self.start_loop()  # Start loop
        self.play(MoveAlongPath(dot, circle), run_time=2, rate_func=linear)
        self.end_loop()  # This will loop until user inputs a key

        self.play(dot.animate.move_to(ORIGIN))
        self.pause()  # Waits user to press continue to go to the next slide

        self.wait()
```

You **must** end your `Slide` with a `self.play(...)` or a `self.wait(...)`.

First, render the animation files:

```bash
manim example.py
# or
manimgl example.py
```

To start the presentation using `Scene1`, `Scene2` and so on simply run:

```bash
manim-slides [OPTIONS] Scene1 Scene2...
```

Or in this example:

```bash
manim-slides Example
```

##  Key Bindings

The default key bindings to control the presentation are:

![manim-wizard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27275099/197468787-19c83a81-d757-47b9-8f68-218427d30298.png)


You can run the **configuration wizard** to change those key bindings:

```bash
manim-slides wizard
```

A default file can be created with:

```bash
manim-slides init
```

> **_NOTE:_**  `manim-slides` uses key codes, which are platform dependent. Using the configuration wizard is therefore highly recommended.

## Other Examples

Other examples are available in the [`example.py`](https://github.com/jeertmans/manim-slides/blob/main/example.py) file, if you downloaded the git repository.

Below is a small recording of me playing with the slides back and forth.

## F.A.Q

### How to increase quality on Windows

On Windows platform, one may encounter a lower image resolution than expected. Usually, this is observed because Windows rescales every application to fit the screen.
As found by [@arashash](https://github.com/arashash), in [#20](https://github.com/jeertmans/manim-slides/issues/20), the problem can be addressed by changing the scaling factor to 100%:

in *Settings*->*Display*.
