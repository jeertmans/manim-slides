# Manim Slides

Tool for live presentations using either [Manim (community edition)](https://www.manim.community/) or [ManimGL](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/). Manim Slides will *automatically* detect the one you are using!

> **NOTE:** this project extends the work of [`manim-presentation`](https://github.com/galatolofederico/manim-presentation), with a lot more features!

## Installation

<!-- start install -->

While installing Manim Slides and its dependencies on your global Python is fine, I recommend using a virtual environment (e.g., [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)) for a local installation.

### Dependencies

<!-- start deps -->

Manim Slides requires either Manim or ManimGL to be installed. Having both packages installed is fine too.

If none of those packages are installed, please refer to their specific installation guidelines:
- [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html)
- [ManimGL](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/getting_started/installation.html)

<!-- end deps -->

### Pip Install

The recommended way to install the latest release is to use pip:

```bash
pip install manim-slides
```

Optionally, you can also install Manim or ManimGL using extras[^1]:

```bash
pip install manim-slides[manim]   # For Manim
# or
pip install manim-slides[manimgl] # For ManimGL
```

[^1]: NOTE: you still need to have Manim or ManimGL platform-specific dependencies installed on your computer.

### Install From Repository

An alternative way to install Manim Slides is to clone the git repository, and install from there: read the [contributing guide](https://eertmans.be/manim-slides/contributing/workflow.html) to know how.

<!-- end install -->

## Usage

<!-- start usage -->

Using Manim Slides is a two-step process:
1. Render animations using `Slide` (resp. `ThreeDSlide`) as a base class instead of `Scene` (resp. `ThreeDScene`), and add calls to `self.next_slide()` everytime you want to create a new slide.
2. Run `manim-slides` on rendered animations and display them like a *Power Point* presentation.

The documentation is available [online](https://eertmans.be/manim-slides/).

### Basic Example

Call `self.next_slide()` everytime you want to create a pause between
animations, and `self.next_slide(loop=True)` if you want the next slide to loop
over animations until the user presses continue:

```python
# example.py

from manim import *  # or: from manimlib import *

from manim_slides import Slide


class BasicExample(Slide):
    def construct(self):
        circle = Circle(radius=3, color=BLUE)
        dot = Dot()

        self.play(GrowFromCenter(circle))
        self.next_slide()  # Waits user to press continue to go to the next slide

        self.next_slide(loop=True)  # Start loop
        self.play(MoveAlongPath(dot, circle), run_time=2, rate_func=linear)
        self.next_slide()  # This will start a new non-looping slide

        self.play(dot.animate.move_to(ORIGIN))
```

First, render the animation files:

```bash
manim example.py BasicExample
# or
manimgl example.py BasicExample
```

To start the presentation using `Scene1`, `Scene2` and so on simply run:

```bash
manim-slides [OPTIONS] Scene1 Scene2...
```

Or in this example:

```bash
manim-slides BasicExample
```

<!-- end usage -->

##  Key Bindings

The default key bindings to control the presentation are:

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeertmans/manim-slides/main/static/wizard_dark.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeertmans/manim-slides/main/static/wizard_light.png">
  <img alt="Manim Slides Wizard" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeertmans/manim-slides/main/static/wizard_light.png">
</picture>


You can run the **configuration wizard** to change those key bindings:

```bash
manim-slides wizard
```

A default file can be created with:

```bash
manim-slides init
```

> **_NOTE:_**  `manim-slides` uses key codes, which are platform dependent. Using the configuration wizard is therefore highly recommended.

## F.A.Q

### How to increase quality on Windows

On Windows platform, one may encounter a lower image resolution than expected. Usually, this is observed because Windows rescales every application to fit the screen.
As found by [@arashash](https://github.com/arashash), in [#20](https://github.com/jeertmans/manim-slides/issues/20), the problem can be addressed by changing the scaling factor to 100%:

![Windows Fix Scaling](static/windows_quality_fix.png)

in *Settings*->*Display*.
