# Manim Slides

Tool for live presentations using either
[Manim (community edition)](https://www.manim.community/)
or [ManimGL](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/).
Manim Slides will *automatically* detect the one you are using!

> [!NOTE]
> This project extends the work of
> [`manim-presentation`](https://github.com/galatolofederico/manim-presentation),
> with a lot more features!

## Installation

Manim Slides requires either Manim or ManimGL to be installed, along
with their dependencies. Please checkout the
[documentation](https://eertmans.be/manim-slides/latest/installation.html)
for detailed install instructions.

## Usage

<!-- start usage -->

Using Manim Slides is a two-step process:
1. Render animations using `Slide` (resp. `ThreeDSlide`) as a base class instead
   of `Scene` (resp. `ThreeDScene`), and add calls to `self.next_slide()`
   everytime you want to create a new slide.
2. Run `manim-slides` on rendered animations and display them like a
   *PowerPoint* presentation.

The documentation is available [online](https://eertmans.be/manim-slides/).

### Basic Example

Call `self.next_slide()` everytime you want to create a pause between
animations, and `self.next_slide(loop=True)` if you want the next slide to loop
over animations until the user presses continue:

```python
from manim import *  # or: from manimlib import *

from manim_slides import Slide


class BasicExample(Slide):
    def construct(self):
        circle = Circle(radius=3, color=BLUE)
        dot = Dot()

        self.play(GrowFromCenter(circle))
        self.next_slide()  # Waits user to press continue to go to the next slide

        self.next_slide(loop=True)  # Start loop
        self.play(MoveAlongPath(dot, circle), run_time=2, rate_func=linear)
        self.next_slide()  # This will start a new non-looping slide

        self.play(dot.animate.move_to(ORIGIN))
```

First, render the animation files:

```bash
manim-slides render example.py BasicExample
# or use ManimGL
manim-slides render --GL example.py BasicExample
```
<!-- end usage -->

> [!NOTE]
> Using `manim-slides render` makes sure to use the `manim`
> (or `manimlib`) library that was installed in the same Python environment.
> Put simply, this is a wrapper around
> `manim render [ARGS]...` (or `manimgl [ARGS]...`).

<!-- start more-usage -->

To start the presentation using `Scene1`, `Scene2` and so on, run:

```bash
manim-slides [OPTIONS] Scene1 Scene2...
```

In our example:

```bash
manim-slides BasicExample
```

<!-- end more-usage -->

## F.A.Q

### How to increase quality on Windows

On Windows platform, one may encounter a lower image resolution than expected.
Usually, this is observed because Windows rescales every application to
fit the screen.
As found by [@arashash](https://github.com/arashash),
in [#20](https://github.com/jeertmans/manim-slides/issues/20),
the problem can be addressed by changing the scaling factor to 100%:
